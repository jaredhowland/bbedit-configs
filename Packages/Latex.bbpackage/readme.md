# Description

A collection of scripts and clippings used to write Latex in BBEdit.

# Installation

## Package only

Download the package at <http://nathangrigg.net/latex-bbpackage>, expand
the archive, and drag the `Latex.bbpackage` package onto the BBEdit
dock icon.

Repeat the process to install an updated version of the package.

Requires BBEdit 10.1 or newer.

## Full git repository

The Latex.bbpackage project is hosted at <http://github.com/nathangrigg/Latex.bbpackage>.

Clone the git repository from the command line

    $ cd Library/Application\ Support/BBEdit/
    $ mkdir Packages # if it doesn't already exist
    $ cd Packages
    $ git clone git://github.com/nathangrigg/Latex.bbpackage.git

Then compile the AppleScripts

    $ cd Latex.bbpackage
    $ ./build

Since, at that point, you're already in the proper directory, you may want to
open up the README markdown document.

	$ bbedit readme.md

Use `git pull` to download an updated version of the package. You will
need to run the `build` script after each update.
